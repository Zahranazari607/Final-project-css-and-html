# Zahra Nazari - Personal Portfolio

This is a personal portfolio website that reflects both my artistic and scientific identity through its design, color palette, and typography. It includes a homepage, about section, portfolio, journaling, Q & A, contact me , and a custom footer with social media links.

## Theme & Inspiration

The theme was inspired by a blend of femininity, science, and art. I chose a combination of **purple, blue, and pink** to express my gentle yet resilient personality. These colors symbolize the harmony between strength and softness.
The design was inspired by:

- Searching portfolios on **Google** and **GitHub**
- My previous design projects (Projects 1 to 4)
- My personal taste in combining aesthetic elegance with structured content

## Fonts Used
I used **two types of fonts**:

- A **formal font** for my main content and personal information
- A **handwritten, artistic font** (found on Google Fonts) that reflects my journaling style. I use it in the blog section to give a diary-like, authentic touch.

## Challenges Faced
- Designing the **overall layout** of the site, especially the **portfolio section**, to be both visually appealing and responsive on mobile and laptop.
- Managing content organization and layout for the first time in a full-scale (though non-functional) site.
- Making the **footer icons spin** and styling the **border effect** around my photo on the homepage took the most time. It required several rounds of trial-and-error and online research.
